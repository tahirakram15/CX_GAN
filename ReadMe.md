# Counterfactual Explanation and Instance-Generation using Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Networks
This Repository contains the code of our submitted paper titled **Counterfactual Explanation and Instance-Generation using Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Networks** at [IEEE Transactions on Image Processing](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=83). In this paper, we present two separate methods to address the counterfactual explanations (CX). A counterfactual explanation (CX) explicates a casual reasoning process of the form: “if X had not happened, then Y would not have happened”
