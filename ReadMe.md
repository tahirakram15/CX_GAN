# Counterfactual Explanation and Instance-Generation using Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Networks
This Repository contains the code of our submitted paper titled **Counterfactual Explanation and Instance-Generation using Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Networks** at [IEEE Transactions on Image Processing](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=83). In this paper, we present two separate methods to address the counterfactual explanations (CX). A counterfactual explanation (CX) explicates a casual reasoning process of the form: “if X had not happened, then Y would not have happened”. However, existing CX
approaches are deficient at supplementing counterfactual explanations with plausible counterfactual instances (CIs). To address the issue, we develop a novel CX/CI generation method in which we view CI generation as unpaired imageto-image translation and CX as image-to-image conversion mapping. The method is built on generative adversarial networks (GANs) with a cyclically-consistent loss function. Initially, we develop a cascaded model to learn CX and CI generation individually. Then, we develop an integrated model for joint learning of both CX and CI. We evaluate our proposed method on three different datasets: [Synthetic](#synthetic-dataset), [Tuberculosis](#tuberculosis-dataset) and [BraTS](#brats-dataset). All experiments confirm the efficacy of the proposed method in generating accurate CX and CI.
